## Week 0
This is notes of preparation works before the class. 

### Install Tensorflow
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) install
- Use   [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)  (recommanded)
- Download Docker image [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/)
`docker run -it —rm -v $(realpath ~/notebooks):/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-py3-jupyter`

Run a Jupyter notebook server with your own notebook directory (assumed here to be ~/notebooks ). To use it, navigate to localhost:8888 in your browser.

- Install with Anaconda 
	- [Installation of TensorFlow (on Mac & Anaconda environment) · SoojungHong/MyDeepLearning Wiki · GitHub](https://github.com/SoojungHong/MyDeepLearning/wiki/Installation-of-TensorFlow-(on-Mac-&-Anaconda-environment))
	- ok just use this  `conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow `

### Create a  Repo in GitHub 
- collect exported files from Bear Notes.
- reading materials. 
- class exercise
